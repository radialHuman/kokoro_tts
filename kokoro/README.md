**Kokoro** is an open-weight TTS model with 82 million parameters. Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects.

> [!NOTE]
> As of April 2025, the market rate of Kokoro served over API is **under $1 per million characters of text input**, or under $0.06 per hour of audio output. (On average, 1000 characters of input is about 1 minute of output.) Sources: [ArtificialAnalysis/Replicate at 65 cents per M chars](https://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-speech/model-family/kokoro#price) and [DeepInfra at 80 cents per M chars](https://deepinfra.com/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M).
>
> This is an Apache-licensed model, and Kokoro has been deployed in numerous projects and commercial APIs. We welcome the deployment of the model in real use cases.

> [!CAUTION]
> Fake websites like kokorottsai_com (snapshot: https://archive.ph/nRRnk) and kokorotts_net (snapshot: https://archive.ph/60opa) are likely scams masquerading under the banner of a popular model.

> Any website containing "kokoro" in its root domain (e.g. kokorottsai_com, kokorotts_net) is **NOT owned by and NOT affiliated with this model page or its author**, and attempts to imply otherwise are red flags.

### Training Details

**Data:** Kokoro was trained exclusively on **permissive/non-copyrighted audio data** and IPA phoneme labels. Examples of permissive/non-copyrighted audio include:
- Public domain audio
- Audio licensed under Apache, MIT, etc
- Synthetic audio<sup>[1]</sup> generated by closed<sup>[2]</sup> TTS models from large providers<br/>
